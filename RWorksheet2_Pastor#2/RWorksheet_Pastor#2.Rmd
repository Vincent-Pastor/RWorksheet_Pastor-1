1. Create a vector using : operator
a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe its output.
```{r, vector = TRUE}
five <- -5:5
five
#The ouput is it display from negative five to positive 5.
```



b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
```{r, vector = TRUE}
x <- 1:7
x
```

\hfill\break
2.* Create a vector using seq() function
a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.
```{r, vector = TRUE}
num1 <- seq(1, 3, by=0.2)
num1

# The output displays the counting of 1 to 3 by 0.2.

b. Write the code and its output.
```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
x

7. R has actually lots of built-in datasets. For example, the rivers data “gives the lengths
(in miles) of 141 “major” rivers in North America, as compiled by the US Geological
Survey”.
a. Type “rivers” in your R console. Create a vector data with 7
elements, containing the number of elements (length) in rivers,
their sum (sum), mean (mean), median (median), variance (var)
standard deviation (sd), minimum (min) and maximum (max).
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers),
b. What are the results?
c. Write the code and its outputs.sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
```{r, error = TRUE}
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers),
sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
data
```

         233, 34, 40, 47, 75, 25, 39, 45, 32, 40, 31)

Data_Ranking <- data.frame(magazine, CelebName, pay)
Data_Ranking
```

b. Modify the power ranking and pay of J.K. Rowling. Change power ranking to 15 and pay to 90.
