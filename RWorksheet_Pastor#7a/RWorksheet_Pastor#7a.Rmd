#RWorksheet 7a

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(Hmisc)
library(pastecs)
```

1. Create a data frame for the table below.

```{r, include=TRUE}
Student <- seq(1:10)
Pre_test <- c(55,54,47,57,51,61,57,54,63,58)
Post_test <- c(61,60,56,63,56,63,59,56,62,61)

df <- data.frame(Student,Pre_test,Post_test)
df
```

a. Compute the descriptive statistics using different packages (Hmisc and pastecs). Write the codes and its result.

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(Hmisc)
library(pastecs)

describe(df)

stat.desc(df)
```

2. The Department of Agriculture was studying the effects of several levels of a fertilizer on the growth of a plant. For some analyses, it might be useful to convert the fertilizer levels to an ordered factor.

```{r, include=TRUE}
Department_of_Agriculture <- c(10,10,10,20,20,50,10,20,10,50,20,50,20,10)
```

a. Write the codes and describe the result.

```{r, include=TRUE}
ord <- sort(Department_of_Agriculture, decreasing = FALSE)
ord
```

3. Abdul Hassan, president of Floor Coverings Unlimited, has asked you to study the exercise levels undertaken by 10 subjects were “l”, “n”, “n”, “i”, “l” ,“l”, “n”, “n”, “i”, “l” ; n=none, l=light, i=intense
```{r, include=TRUE}
Subjects <- c("l","n","n","i","l","l","n","n","i","l")
```
a. What is the best way to represent this in R?

```{r, include=TRUE}

subs <- data.frame(Subjects)
subs 

# Answer: Dataframe
```

4.Sample of 30 tax accountants from all the states and territories of Australia and their individual state of origin is specified by a character vector of state mnemonics as:

```{r, include=TRUE}
state <- c("tas", "sa", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "nt", "wa", "wa", "qld",
           "vic", "nsw", "vic", "qld", "qld", "sa", "tas", "sa", "nt",
           "wa", "vic", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "wa", "sa", "act", "nsw",
           "vic", "vic", "act")
state 
```

a. Apply the factor function and factor level. Describe the results.

```{r, include=TRUE}
ff <- factor(state)
ff
```

5. From #4 - continuation:
• Suppose we have the incomes of the same tax accountants in another vector 

```{r, include=TRUE}
incomes <- c(60, 49, 40, 61, 64, 60, 59, 54,
             62, 69, 70, 42, 56, 61, 61, 61, 58, 51, 48,
             65, 49, 49, 41, 48, 52, 46, 59, 46, 58, 43)
incomes
```

a. Calculate the sample mean income for each state we can now use the special function tapply():

```{r, include=TRUE}
cal <- tapply(state, incomes, mean)
cal
```

b. Copy the results and interpret.

### 40 41 42 43 46 48 49 51 52 54 56 58 59 60 61 62 64 65 69 70 
### NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

6.Calculate the standard errors of the state income means (refer again to number 3)
a. What is the standard error? Write the codes.

```{r, include=TRUE}
stdError <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
stdError(subs)
incster <- tapply(incomes, state, stdError)

### Answer: NA
```

b. Interpret the result is not available because some variables are character type so it won't able to get the standard error.

7. Use the titanic dataset.

```{r, include=TRUE}
data("Titanic")

head<- data.frame(Titanic)
```

a. subset the titatic dataset of those who survived and not survived. Show the codes and its result.

```{r, include=TRUE}
hsbst <- subset(head, select = "Survived")
hsbst
```

8. The data sets are about the breast cancer Wisconsin. The samples arrive periodically as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases. The database therefore reflects this chronological grouping of the data. You can create this dataset in Microsoft Excel.

a. describe what is the dataset all about.

### The dataset is all about patients with Breast Cancer.

b. Import the data from MS Excel. Copy the codes.

```{r, include=TRUE}
library("readxl")
data <- read_excel("/cloud/project/RWorksheet_Pastor#7a/Breast_Cancer.xlsx")
data
```

c. Compute the descriptive statistics using different packages. Find the values of:

c.1 Standard error of the mean for clump thickness.

```{r, include=TRUE}
clump <- length(data$`CL. thickness`)
clump1 <- sd(data$`CL. thickness`)
clump2 <- clump1/sqrt(data$`CL. thickness`)
clump2
```

c.2 Coefficient of variability for Marginal Adhesion.

```{r, include=TRUE}
cov <- sd(data$`Marg. Adhesion`) / mean(data$`Marg. Adhesion`)* 100
cov
```

c.3 Number of null values of Bare Nuclei.

```{r, include=TRUE}
nv <- subset(data,`Bare. Nuclei` == "NA")
nv
```

c.4 Mean and standard deviation for Bland Chromatin

```{r, include=TRUE}
mean(data$`Bl. Cromatin`)
sd(data$`Bl. Cromatin`)
```

c.5 Confidence interval of the mean for Uniformity of Cell Shape
Calculate the mean,

```{r, include=TRUE}
calm <- mean(data$`Cell Shape`)
calm
```

Calculate the standard error of the mean

```{r, include=TRUE}
se <- length(data$`Cell Shape`)
se1 <- sd(data$`Cell Shape`)
ser <- se1/sqrt(se)
ser
```

Find the t-score that corresponds to the confidence level.

```{r, include=TRUE}
tscore = 0.05
tse = se - 1
cl = qt(p = tscore/ 2, df = tse,lower.tail = F)
cl
```

Constructing the confidence interval

```{r, include=TRUE}
ci <- cl * ser
```

Lower

```{r, include=TRUE}
lower <- calm - ci
```

Upper

```{r, include=TRUE}
upp <- calm + ci

grpLU <- c(lower,upp)
```


d. How many attributes?

```{r, include=TRUE}
att <- attributes(data)
att
```

e. Find the percentage of respondents who are malignant. Interpret the results.

```{r, include=TRUE}
perres <- subset(data, Class == "malignant")
perres
```

There 18 respondents who are malignant dnd there are total of 49 respondents.
Getting the percentage

```{r, include=TRUE}
pers <- 17  / 49 * 100
pers
```

9. Export the data abalone to the Microsoft excel file. Copy the codes.
install.packages("AppliedPredictiveModeling")

```{r, include=TRUE}

library("AppliedPredictiveModeling")
data("abalone")
# View(abalone)
head(abalone)
summary(abalone)

```

Exporting the data abalone to the Microsoft excel file
install.packages("xlsxjars")

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(xlsx)
write.xlsx(abalone, "abalone.xlsx")
```
